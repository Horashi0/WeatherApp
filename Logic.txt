Start website -> Default to Today and Now with SelectedDay and SelectedTime 

-> Call API with day and time -> Check for button presses -> call specific functions

Logic of TimeBar:
- Remove any times that overlap onto other days
- Maintain time selection between days
- When a time is selected that cant be maintained e.g. 00:00 then switch to Today and its 3pm, then switch to Now
